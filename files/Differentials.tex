\subsection*{infinitesimals}
We say that the derivative $dy/dx$ is the slope of the tangent to the curve $y = f(x)$ at some particular point $(x,y)$;  it is the slope of a line that just touches the curve.

And it is frequently called the slope of the curve at the point $(x,y)$.

We saw a formal definition for the derivative in terms of an expression for $\Delta y$ as a function of $\Delta x$, which is then divided by $\Delta x$.  We determine what is called the "limit" as $\Delta x$ approaches zero.
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \]

There appears to be a contradiction here.  On one hand, we're saying that $\Delta x$ must approach zero.  On the other hand, it cannot really be zero, because division by zero is not defined.  So how close does it have to be to zero?  

Are $dy$ and $dx$ small, really small, really really small, or almost zero?  

The official answer requires a cumbersome apparatus of limits, and it would say that $dy/dx$ is not a quotient at all, but rather a single entity, the limit of a quotient, as we just said:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \]

However, our simple answer is that $dx$ and $dy$ are separable entities and they are just as small as they need to be.  Take the example we used previously:
 \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = 3cx^2 \]
Put the $dx$ on the right-hand side:
\[ dy = 3cx^2 \ dx \]

What this expression says is that for a small change in $x$ which we call $dx$, we will obtain a small change in $y$ called $dy$ with the given relationship.  $3cx^2$ gives the proportionality between $dx$ and $dy$.

Suppose we evaluate $3cx^2$ at some particular $x_0$.  Then it is a number, it has a fixed value depending on where we are on the curve.  So write it as $k = 3cx_0^2$ and then:
\[ dy = k \ dx \]
When we write this, we are making a \emph{linear approximation} to the quadratic function.  $dy$ is not exactly equal to $k \ dx$, for most situations we are ignoring quadratic and higher terms.

Here, we treat $dy$ and $dx$ as very small but non-zero quantities.  If there should ever be a problem because we've chosen $\Delta x$ too large, just reduce it by some factor ($1/10$, $10^{-6}$, $1/$googol), whatever is needed,

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol}

and try again until the problem disappears (it will).  Make $dx$ and $dy$ really really small.  If that's not small enough, try making them smaller still.

By this trick, we free ourselves from limits.  If you want to multiply by $dx$ on both sides of an equality
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = n x^{n-1} \]
\[ dx \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = dy = n x^{n-1} \ dx \]
Feel free, go ahead and do it.

\subsection*{fancy}

If you want to read more about the derivative as a limit, why $dy/dx$ is not a quotient, and so on, you can look at any standard calculus book.  Or start here

\url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/21199/is-frac-textrmdy-textrmdx-not-a-ratio}

The bottom line is that we want $dy$ and $dx$ to be very small compared to $y$ and $x$, but one of the properties of the real numbers is that no matter how very small we choose $A$ (or $dx$), there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n \cdot A > B$ (or $n \cdot dx > x$).  This is called the Archimedean property of the real numbers.

Effectively what limits and neighborhoods do is to say, OK smart guy, you go first.  Pick $n$.  Then once you've picked $n$ very large, we can always find $dx$ very very small so that $n \cdot dx$ is still small compared with $x$.  That's the whole trick.

However, in practice none of this is a problem because we view $dy$ and $dx$ as very small.  Although often we only care about their ratio, some times we will need to separate them.  This is legal, trust me.

\subsection*{Shankar}

In the first lecture of his first course on Physics, Shankar has this to say about differentials.  We are working with acceleration and velocity in the $x$-direction so we write
\[ \frac{dv}{dt} = a \]

Now, multiply both sides by $v$ but use $v = dx/dt$ on the right-hand side
\[ v \frac{dv}{dt} = a \frac{dx}{dt} \]

Shankar says

\begin{quote}
canceling the $dt$ on both sides gives valid results if interpreted carefully.
\end{quote}

\[ v \ dv = a \ dx \]

\begin{quote}
it must be understood that the two sides of a relation like (the above) are to be ultimately integrated between some limits to obtain a useful equality.
\end{quote}

Thus
\[ \int_{v_0}^v v \ dv = \int_{x_0}^x a \ dx \]
\[ v^2 - v_0^2 = 2a(x - x_0) \]
which is convenient in some cases when we want to know the velocity at a particular position or the converse.

We can check this result with an alternative derivation using the fundamental equation of motion for $x$ as a function of $t$
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} at^2 + v_0 t + x_0 \]
\[ x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2} at^2 + v_0 t \]

from which $t$ is removed by the following trick.  

Differentiating, we have $v = at + v_0$ so then $t = (v - v_0)/a$.

Substitute into the original

\[ x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2} a(\frac{v-v_0}{a})^2 + v_0 \frac{v-v_0}{a} \]
\[ 2a(x - x_0) = (v-v_0)^2 +  2v_0(v-v_0) \]
\[ = (v - v_0)(v - v_0 + 2v_0) \]
\[ = v^2 -v_0^2 \]

It should be emphasized that $x$ and $v$ are the values at the identical time.

As an example, suppose we have $a = -10$ m/s$^2$, $v_0 = 10$ m/s, and $x_0 = 15$ m.  At the maximum height, the velocity is zero, so

\[ 2a(x - x_0) = -v_0^2 \]
\[ 20(x - 15) = 100 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Check this result by starting with
\[ x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2} at^2 + v_0 t \]
and setting the first derivative equal to zero
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = v = 0 = at + v_0 \]
\[ t = \frac{-10}{-10} = 1 \]

So then
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} at^2 + v_0 t + x_0 \]
\[ = -5 + 10 + 15 = 20 \]
